# HOW TO RUN PROGRAM

	# To run the program you need to navigate to the "src" folder and open up two terminals:

#Terminal 1:

Run one of the following commands:

	python3 server.py
	
	python server.py


This will run a server and provide the following services to handle a To Do list 		application: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE


#Terminal 2:

Run the following command to open up a browser that provides a user interface that lets you use the program

	npm start
    
In the interface you can add and delete To Do's from a list, clear all To Do's and mark them as completed

The interface will by default run at: http://localhost:5000/api/items/
